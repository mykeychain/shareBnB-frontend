# ShareBnB 

ShareBnB is a fullstack Airbnb clone where hosts can list their backyard or pool spaces for rent by other users. ShareBnB utilizes a React frontend, a Flask backend, and AWS S3 for photo uploads. For ease of deployment, the backend repository has been separated and can be found [here](https://github.com/ncuenca/shareBnB-backend).

ShareBnB allows users to sign-up or login. Authentication is implemented with JSON Web Tokens and middleware. Once logged in, users have access to the following features: 
    - view all current listings
    - search for listings by name
    - add a listing and upload their own photos
    - send and receive private messages with other users

You can view the deployed version of ShareBnB here.
